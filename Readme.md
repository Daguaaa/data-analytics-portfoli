## 1. Uber & Lyft Surge Analysis — From Data Exploration to ML Prediction

**Project Overview:**  
📍 Part 1: Foundations (Exploratory Data Analysis)
Goal: Identify the best hours and days to drive to maximize earnings using descriptive statistics.

Dataset: 693k rides featuring distance, price, and surge_multiplier.

Analysis: Cleaned data, engineered expected_earnings features, and utilized heatmaps to identify high-earning windows (e.g., Wednesday 1–2 AM).

🤖 Part 2: Advanced Predictive Modeling & BI
Goal: Build a Random Forest classifier to predict surge events with high precision and identify geographic "Surge Superhighways."

The Breakthrough: Engineered Spatial-Temporal Hubs and optimized the model to an 81% confidence threshold to eliminate false-positive alerts.

Key Discovery: Identified that the Back Bay ➔ Boston University corridor is a primary driver of mid-week midnight surges.
